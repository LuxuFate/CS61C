# numc

Here's what I did in project 4:

    I first started in matrix.c, where I implemented naive versions of the matrix operations, where I just used for loops to do matrix multiplication, power, and the simple methods. In numc.c I implemented the PyObject versions of the matrix manipulation methods. These methods would call the original functions in matrix.c, but also have error throwing included into them, where I would have to throw Type or Value errors. I had to convert between the c and Pyobject values by using the PyObject documentations as well as type casting. For speeding up the matrix operations, I used various methods on different operations. For add and sub, I used SIMD instructions as well as OMP in order to speed them up. For neg and abs, I used unrolling and OMP to speed them up. For mul, I used different methods for different sizes of inputs. For small inputs, I just used unrolling in my for loop. For medium inputs, I used SIMD instructions, unrolling, and also OMP. For large inputs, I transposed the second matrix to try to take advantage of the cache behavior. For the transpose, I used OMP and unrolling. Since after transposing, the two matrices can be multiplied by the rows, I use a double for loop for each entry and used OMP, SIMD instructions, and unrolling for the multiplication. For pow, I used repeated squaring.
